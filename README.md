- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kai Lawson-McDowall

- ðŸ‘€ Right now, Iâ€™m interested in projects around statistics and bioinformatics. In particular, I'll be starting a project which will focus on applying machine learning to see if I can update or improve some cancer models. In the  more immediate future, I'm hoping to develop a pipeline to check model assumptions of linear regression models and their data! 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m mainly focusing on the use of R at the moment, but am also working with Python and Bash
